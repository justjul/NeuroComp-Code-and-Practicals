# Tutorials
This folder contains a series of step-by-step tutorials that demonstrate how to use the toolbox provided in the [Code](../Code) folder. 
They were designed to help you gain a practical understanding of the toolbox's capabilities and how to apply them to your own data.

The tutorials cover the following topics:
* pre-processing neurophysiological and behavioral recordings (Tutorial1)
* estimating tuning curves by linear average (Tutorial2.1)
* fitting Generalized Linear Models and performing model comparisons (Tutorial2.2)
* decoding variables from spike trains using a Bayesian approach (Tutorial3.1)
* detecting cell assemblies using PCA and ICA (Tutorial3.2)
* calculating trial-by-trial correlations between cell pairs (Tutorial3.3)
* using wavelet transform and coherence to investigate the selectivity of oscillatory signals (Tutorial4.1)

More specifically, each tutorial went step-by-step through the code of the following functions:
- Tutorial1: [LoaddataNav and LoaddataSpk](../Code/Load)
- Tutorial2.1: [MapsAnalysis](../Code/Maps)
- Tutorial2.2: [GLMAnalysis](../Code/GLMs)
- Tutorial3.1: [DecodingAnalysis](../Code/Decoding)
- Tutorial3.2: [PatternAnalysis](../Code/Patterns)
- Tutorial3.3: [CorssCorrAnalysis](../Code/Corr)
- Tutorial4.1: [TFMapsAnalysis](../Code/TFMaps)
- The last tutorial (Tutorial_handson) is a simple cheatsheet with short examples on how to use the functions detailed in the previous tutorials.

For more details, see the readme and help sections of the corresponding functions in the [Code](../Code) folder.

The code was written by Julien Fournier and Tulio Fernandez de Almeida. Tutorials were designed by Julien Fournier, Tulio Fernandez de Almeida, Olivier Peron, Mehdi Fallahnezhad, Gabrielle Girardeau and Nicolas Gervasi.
